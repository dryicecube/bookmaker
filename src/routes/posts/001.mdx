# What is a factorial?
Suppose we have 5 pieces of Art in an Art Show. In how many ways can we arrange them in a line? The 1st work (any one of them) can be in 5 different spots. The second one of them can be now in 4 spots since 1 spot is taken by the first work. But the 4 of the 2nd work DEPEND on which spot is taken for the 1st because for each position of the first work we have 4 different sets of spots say

- _ _ _ \_ 1
- _ _ \_ 1 \_
- \_ \_ 1 \_ _
- \_ 1 _ _ _
- 1 _ _ _ _

For each of these cases the 2 can be in 4 different places making the total possibilities for just 2 works 20 places. The third one will now have one less spot to choose from so 3 and so on. 5x4x3x2x1. This descending multiplication is what is called a factorial represented as $5!$

**Caveat**: So now any n objects can be permuted in $n!$ ways. But what if we have 0 objects? What is $0!$? Since the number of ways to arrange 0 objects is just 1, no way at all (that is still a way) we define artificially 0! = 1.

# What is then the factorial of a real number?

We now take the first few points and plot them. What happens however when we fill in the gaps and smooth out the connections between the points? We get a curve called the Gamma Function (`Γ-function`) first discovered by [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler). This function allows us to calculate the factorials for all real numbers.

### Interpreting the Γ function
It may at first thought seem absurd to think of the number of arrangements of 0.5 objects! or even 3.14 objects and is very much so. The `Γ-function` however is first and foremost a generalization, so that is what it helps us to do, Generalize.

# What is then the factorial of a real number?

The derivation of the Gamma function is somewhat of a hack, we make in a sense an educated guess rather than arriving at it systematically. Consider $e^{ax}$. We know for a fact that when we differentiate it w.r.t $x$ we will get a an extra a below.

$$\frac{d}{dx}e^{ax}=ae^{ax}$$

Now we we just run that with $a$ instead of $x$

$$\frac{d}{da}e^{ax}=xe^{ax}$$

We get an infinite revenue stream of $x$'s so long as we keep differentiating. So after $n$ times we are at  $x^n e^{ax}$. Similarly we know as we keep differentiating $1/a$ we get $\frac{((-1)^{n+1})(n!)}{a^{n+1}}$. We will stash these two facts into storage for now.

Now consider

$$\int_0^\infty e^{ax} dx = -\frac{1}{a} \quad \forall a\leq 0$$

Remember we need to generate $n!$ in the numerator, so we now differentiate both sides w.r.t $a$ (Note: $a$ and NOT $x$). This will let us do differentiation on both sides without touching the integral sign on the left.

On the left we do $\frac{d}{da}e^{ax}$, $n$ times as from before, and on the right we differentiate $\frac{d}{da} \ \ \frac{1}{a}$ as we did $\frac{d}{dx} \ \ \frac{1}{x}$ in just after that. We therefore get

$$\int_0^\infty x^n e^{ax} dx = \frac{(-1)^{n+1}n!}{a^{n+1}} \quad \forall a\leq 0$$

Now we just substitute for $a=-1$ both sides since that is a parameter anyway, helping us cancel out the oscillating negative sign at the same time.

$$\int_0^\infty x^n e^{-x} dx = n!$$

We have almost reached the final of the Gamma function. We can see on the left is a continuously varying function in x giving exactly equal to the factorial function on the right. The gamma function however is derived at an offset of 1, which we can simply add by doing n &rarr; n-1. Giving Us

$$\Gamma(n) = (n-1)! = \int_0^\infty x^{n-1} e^{-x} dx$$

## Properties
Now that we have the Gamma function we can consider evaluating it at non positive numbers specially complex numbers once we set aside a few properties
