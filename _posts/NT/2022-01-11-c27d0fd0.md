# What is a factorial?
Suppose we have 5 pieces of Art in an Art Show. In how many ways can we arrange them linearly? The 1st work (any one of them) can be in 5 different spots. The second one of them can be now in 4 spots since 1 spot is taken by the first work. But the 4 of the 2nd work DEPEND on which spot is taken for the 1st because for each position of the first work we have 4 different sets of spots say

- _ _ _ _ 1
- _ _ _ 1 _
- _ _ 1 _ _
- _ 1 _ _ _
- 1 _ _ _ _

For each of these cases the 2 can be in 4 different places making the total possibilities for just 2 works 20 places. The third one will now have one less spot to choose from so 3 and so on. 5x4x3x2x1. This descending multiplication is what is called a factorial represented as ```5!```.

**Caveat**: So now any n objects can be permuted in ```n!``` ways. But what if we have 0 objects? What is ```0!```? Since the number of ways to arrange 0 objects is just 1, no way at all (that is still a way) we define artificially 0! = 1.

## What is then the factorial of a real number?

```matlab
1! = 1
2! = 2x1 = 2
3! = 3x2x1 = 6
4! = 24
5! = 120
```

We now take the first few points and plot them. What happens however when we fill in the gaps and smooth out the connections between the points? We get a curve called the Gamma Function (```Γ-function```) first discovered by [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler). This function allows us to calculate the factorials for all real numbers.

### Interpreting the Γ function
It may at first thought seem absurd to think of the number of arrangements of 0.5 objects! or even 3.14 objects and is very much so. The ```Γ-function``` however is first and foremost a generalization, so that is what it helps us to do, Generalize.
